,"Whether I go or not, I'll die anyway. I have an organ more important than my heart. Although you can't see it, I feel it going through my head down to my feet, and I know it exists within me. It lets me stand on my feet, it lets me walk forward without trembling. If I stop here, I feel like it would break... My soul will break.

Honest feelings can sometimes lead to cruel endings.,Gintoki Sakata
It feels so close to me, yet I can't reach it even if I hold out my hands. But even if I can't reach it, there are things that will stay in my heart. Being in the same time and looking at the same sky – if I can remember that, then even if we are far apart, I believe we can still be together.

When I watch you, I feel strong, like I can do anything - that even I am worth something.

I hate nice girls. Just exchanging greetings with them will get them on your mind. Start texting each other, and your heart will be set a flutter. If they call you, you're done for. Enjoy staring at your logs and grinning like a fool. However, I won't get fooled again. That's what your kind calls kindness. If you're nice to me, you're nice to others. I always end up nearly forgetting that. Reality is cruel, so I'm sure lies are a form of kindness. Thus, I say kindness itself is also a lie. I always ended up with these expectations. And I always ended up with these misunderstandings. And before I knew it, I stopped hoping. A highly trained loner is once bitten, twice shy. As a veteran on this battlefield of life, I've gotten used to losing. That's why I always hate nice girls.

Living should mean no do-overs. This is for the best.,Rintarou Okabe
People remember their high school days as the high point of their lives. People say these things because everyone holds fond memories of their time in high school; however, I doubt that every high school student would want to remember their school life that way. For example, if neither studying, nor sports, nor socializing are of interest to someone, what then? What if there are students who prefer to keep a low profile? Though I guess that would be a pretty lonely way to live.

What is right? What is wrong? In this mixed up world, deciding what is right and wrong is not easy. You can't just go by somebody else's rules. If you let yourself be controlled like that, you'll just become a puppet that can't make decisions on it's own. You have to live by your rules.

It's difficult to like me when I'm being myself.,Ami Kawashima
As long as there is at least one person who understands me, I'll be okay.
--Ami Kawashima
It isn't just ""others"". Not ""others"". It's my Family. I'll force my ideals on my family. And since they're family, I'll lie to them. I'll deceive them. I'll cause them trouble. I'll make them worry. I'll owe them things, things I'll never be able to repay. However, I think that's okay. If you say that being an impostor is evil, then I will shoulder the burden of that evil. If lying is a bad thing, then I'm fine being the bad person. I don't need them to like me. I'm fine with being the worst kind of person.

The Present is ending. Here, countless versions of our past selves are always crying, laughing, falling in love, getting hurt, joking around, feeling happy and suffering.

Right after it's born, every moment becomes the past and dies.

People... humans are the being who look for happiness. What the Britannian boy, Lelouch, wanted to have was nothing but a small happiness. It's nothing special. At least at the root of his motives, there were only humble wishes that were simply natural to any human. Who could ever disclaim such dreams and such vows? Who could ever have the right to do that? However, whoever you might be, without choice, you have to deal with others and with the world, and have yourself be regulated and set down. Therefore, in the face of the world's wills, your personal speculations are so ephemeral they can't help being overwhelmed. Sins and punishments, destiny and judgment. What stands in front of Lelouch is the past he brought forth by himself. Is it a hatred resulting from the fact that humans are humans? Nonetheless, for now, we should be grateful... Yes, at least, to the fact that humans are the beings who look for happiness.

Different conclusions are reached when one fact is viewed from two separate points of view. When that happens, there is no immediate way to judge which point of view is the correct one.

--Archer
I admired his desire to save people because it was beautiful! But none of that feeling is my own! What else can you call it but hypocrisy?! I was driven by my obsessive need to help someone.

You wanted revenge? You're just making other people as miserable as you. Revenge is just the path you took to escape your suffering.,Ichigo Kurosaki

--Kakashi Hatake
In society, those who don't have many abilities, tend to complain more.
--Kakashi Hatake
The hole in one's heart gets filled by others around you. Friends won't flock to someone who abandons the memory of his friends and gives up on the world just because things don't go the way he wants them to. That won't help fill the hole in your heart. And people won't help those who run away and do nothing. As long as you don't give up, there will always be salvation.
--Kakashi Hatake
In the shinobi world, those that break the written and unwritten rules are deemed trash... but be that as it may... Those that would desregard their comrades so easily are even worse than trash. And those who don't have the decency to respect the memories of their comrades are the worst.
--Kakashi Hatake
I really am... shinobi trash. But the one thing I still learned is this. That void is something that everyone helps you fill. Just because you face adversity and hardships, is no reason to give up on this world. A person willing to throw away all those memories... of their friends and comrades, will never find peace of mind. Resorting to something like that isn't going to bury that hole. If you persevere and endure, someone will be there to support you!
--Kakashi Hatake
I've lived longer than you. And times have been bad. I know the pain of loss. You and I haven't really been fortunate. It's true. But it could be worse. For me, and for you, too... We've found good friends, haven't we? Because of your losses, you should understand.
--Kakashi Hatake
Sorry I'm late guys, a black cat crossed my path so I had to go the long way.

There are... many types of monsters in this world: Monsters who will not show themselves and who cause trouble; monsters who abduct children; monsters who devour dreams; monsters who suck blood, and... monsters who always tell lies. Lying monsters are a real nuisance. They are much more cunning than other monsters. They pose as humans even though they have no understanding of the human heart. They eat even though they've never experienced hunger. They study even though they have no interest in academics. They seek friendship even though they do not know how to love. If I were to encounter such a monster, I would likely be eaten by it. Because in truth, I am that monster.

No matter how beautiful a person may be, they will still age and ultimately - die. But even so, even if appearances change, don't you believe that we have, in us, things that don't change? Even as our bodies crumble, even as the months and years take their toll... don't you believe that we all have something that time can't spoil? Even if you cover us with wrinkles, we won't lose to you. That's because we know what beauty truly is.

When your friend is crying, cry with him. When your friend is worried, you should worry with him. And when your friend has an awkward bowel movement, then you must have an awkward bowel movement too. If you are a friend, you should be able to share the other's pain, no matter what. And if your friend goes down the wrong path... Then, you must stop your friend, even if it ruins your friendship. That is true samurai friendship.

In a way, the supernatural is what's behind the curtain. Normally, you only need to see what's happening on stage. That's how reality works. If you don't know, it's best that you don't. Actually, learning about the supernatural only increases the number of things you don't know.

Everything we see, everyone we meet, is caught up in a great unseen flow. But it's bigger than that. It's the entire world, the entire universe even. And compared to something as big as that, Al, you and I are tiny, not even the size of ants. Only one small part within a much greater flow. Nothing more than a fraction of the whole. But by putting all those ""ones"" together, you get one great ""All"
-- just like Teacher said. The flow of this universe follows laws of such magnitude that you and I can't even imagine them.
--Edward Elric
I've been thinking about this for a long time. We put all our trust in alchemy but in the end... what is it? ""Alchemy is the science of understanding the flow of matter and its laws. The process of comprehension, deconstruction, and reconstruction. The world flows too. It must also follow laws. Everything circulates. Even death is a part of that circulation. You must accept the flow."" Hmm, Teacher sure drummed that into our heads, didn't she? I thought I understood it. But I don't understand anything... Mom proves that. Now here I am again, trying desperately to figure out a way to do the impossible. I'm such a hopeless idiot. All this time and I haven't grown up one bit. I thought maybe the rain would wash away some of this gloom that's been following me... but right now, every drop that hits my face is even more depressing.

Trying to shoulder the burden all by yourself? Don't be a stranger. Weep and ask for help. Lean on me with your runny nose. Cry when you feel like crying. Laugh when you feel like laughing. When you're tearing up with an ugly face, I'll give you a good cry with an uglier face. When you're laughing so hard your stomach hurts, I'll laugh in a louder voice. That's how it should be.

It's not a sense of justice. Figuring out difficult cases is my hobby. If you measured good and evil deeds by current laws, I would be responsible for many crimes. The same way you all like to solve mysteries and riddles, or clear video games more quickly. For me too, it's simply prolonging something I enjoy doing. That's why I only take on cases that pique my interest. It's not justice at all. And if it means being able to clear a case, I don't play fair, I'm a dishonest, cheating human being who hates losing.

*about girls* C'mon. You know what they're like. You can never figure them out. You never know where you could stand with them. The smallest things could put you in their bad side.

--Shirou Emiya
Even if I could redo the past, I must not take back what has already happened, because if I do that, everything would be a lie: those tears, that pain, those memories, that cold reality that hurts my heart, all of it. There were people who died in pain. There were people who risked their lives to save others. There were people who mourned for the deaths. But then, if everything were taken back and it did not happen, where would all of those go? The dead people would not come back. Reality cannot be overturned. To continue on remembering the pain and the weight… isn't that how lost things remain? People will eventually die and death itself is sad, but pain shouldn't be the only thing that remains. A death is painful, but it also leaves behind bright memories. As I am bound by these people's deaths… As I am protected by my memories of Kiritsugu... I believe memories become constraints and change the people living now... Even if... They are memories that will eventually be forgotten.

Blue sky is in the distance. It feels so close. Yet, I cannot grab it even if I reach out with my hands. I looked up at the stars before. The stars that I cannot reach and the wishes that will not be granted. There is nothing we have been able to leave behind for each other. Therefore, traces and memories will disappear someday. But still... Even if it will not reach her, there should be something that will remain in our hearts. There is nothing that remains in our hands, but we lived the same time and looked up at the same things. If I can remember that. I can believe that we can be together even if we are far apart.

That is why I will keep running for now. If I aim for the distance, there should come a day when I would be able to reach out to what I have been aiming for.

The great flow that maintains the universe, call it the cycle of life, the course of nature each one of us is just a small part of that part. One in the all.

Knowledge and awareness are vague, and perhaps better called illusions. Everyone lives within their own subjective interpretation.
--Itachi Uchiha
I'll admit that you're stronger than before. But because of that, you seem to have lost sight of what's truly important. Now listen carefully. The people of the village, who once abhorred you, have begun to admire you. They think of you as a comrade. It's because you fought hard for their acceptance. You once said it was everyone who cares about you who helped you get where you are now. If you forget others because you have power, and become arrogant and egotistical, you'll eventually become just like Madara. No matter how powerful you become, do not try to shoulder everything alone. Becoming the Hokage doesn't mean people will acknowledge you. But when the people acknowledge you, you can become Hokage.

But I failed, and speaking to you now, like this, isn't going to undo the permanent damage that's already been done to you. That's why I wanted to show you the truth. Even if it's just a little. And no matter what you decide to do from here on out, you never have to forgive me - I will always love you.

You'll be in a world where no one but you remembers me. You care more about your friends than anything else, so I think it's going to be painful for you. I'm so sorry. But that pain will mean a lot to me. Whenever you're sitting around in the lab, whenever you sip a drink, whenever you walk around town ... it doesn't have to be every time - one time out of a hundred is fine.

Well, a lot of things really did take place… I’m sure that’s the way it should be… I’m sure that everybody carries a certain burden of their own.

In the end, I couldn't see things from the parasites' perspective, never mind from Migi's. Of course not. It wasn't possible from the beginning. As two different species, we may at times take advantage of each other and kill each other, but it's impossible to understand each other. Actually, you shouldn't even think that you've figured out another species based on your standards. I think it's human arrogance to think we understand how other life forms feel. There may be no other life forms that are truly a ""friend"" to man. Still, even if we can't comprehend them, they are, without a doubt, neighbors deserving of our respect. We protect other species because humans themselves are lonely creatures. We protect the environment because humans themselves don't want to go extinct. What drives us is simply self-gratification. But I think that's fine, and that it's really all there is to it. There's no point in despising humans by human standards. That's right. So in the end, it's hypocritical for us to love Earth without loving ourselves.

I choose my own battlefields. Not by my blood, but by my heart! I stand on the battlefield to protect what's important to me. And if anyone stands in my way, I don't care if it's one of my kind, my brother or anyone else… I'll crush them all!

It hasn't withered. I won't let it wither. We might just be little branches, but if the branches break off, the tree really will wither. That's why I won't break off. Even if winter comes and the leaves fall off, even if the wind comes and all the other little branches break off... Even if I am the last branch left, I won't break off. I'm sure we'll be together till the end.

Everyone is a slave to their past. No matter how much you wish to move forward, the events of last year will bear down on you like the light of the stars as soon as you glance up.

One ought to experience loneliness at least once or twice in life. No, you have to experience it. The idea of being chained to another person without reprieve is far more abnormal and disquieting. One has no choice but to learn about loneliness. I’m sure some things can’t be experienced without it.

I like myself. I have never once hated myself. My high specs, my half-decent looks, my pessimistic, realist point of view... I don't hate any of it at all.

Forcing yourself to like something you don't like brings sorrow.,Hachiman Hikigaya
As they say about the vulgar masses, the more people flock to a group, the more foolish they become. No matter how prominent an individual is, no, it’s because he is prominent that he would be blotted out by the sheer force of numbers when thrown into that lump of people. Individual will, qualifications, and personality, let alone emotions aren’t considered at all. We see only what we want to see, listen only to what we want to listen to, but for the things we want to say, we aren’t able to. This is the society that we’re living in right now.
--Hachiman Hikigaya
I'm always alone. Other people don't factor into what I do. The things that happen in front of me are parts of my life and my life alone.,Hachiman Hikigaya
What the hell is with everyone telling me to change? I don't want other people telling me who I am.,Hachiman Hikigaya
Merits, demerits, risks, returns; if they were these things then I understood. I could understand. Desire and self-protection, hatred from jealousy. I could analyze the mentality of the actions that were grounded on these abundant, repulsive emotions. That's because I had plenty of those ugly feelings inside of me. That's why it was simple to imagine. if they were similar things, then there was still room to understand it. I could explain using logic. However, if there wasn't, then it was difficult. Without the concept of profit and loss, it was hard to imagine the feelings of people who went beyond people who went beyond logic and theory. I had too little to go on and above all else. I had committed too many mistakes up until now. Good will, friendship, or even love; they were all things I had been mistaken with. I was sure that I was mistaken with them even now as I thought about them.
--Hachiman Hikigaya
When a girl calls someone a ""nice guy"
-- it means she couldn't care less about him.
--Hachiman Hikigaya
The concept of lateness being evil is wrong in the first place... The police don't mobilize until after an accident happens, and it's standard for heroes to show up late. But would anyone condemn them for being late? So, speaking paradoxically, lateness is justice.
--Hachiman Hikigaya
""True to herself"
-- ""True to myself"". We all have our own personal image that's dictated by others, one that's always off the mark. We wish to remain true to ourselves, but who gets to decide who we are as people? When our image never goes hand-in-hand with reality, where can we find something genuine? Where can we find our true selves?
--Hachiman Hikigaya
It's arrogant to think just saying things out loud is enough. Self-gratifying on the part of the speaker, and conceited on the part of the listener. You won't always come to an understanding by talking things out.
--Hachiman Hikigaya
Expecting others to read your mind is delusional. But... But... I... I...""It's not empty words I'm after. There was something else I desired all along. Not mutual understanding, friendship, companionship, or anything of the sort. I don't care about being understood. I simply wish to understand. Understand, know, and rest easy in that knowledge-- gain some peace of mind. Wanting to know people inside-out because being in the dark terrifies me is an awfully self-indulgement, egoistic, and arrogant wish. It's downright despicable and disgusting. Having a desire like that makes me sick to the stomach! But if it's at all possible to share that desire-- if it's possible to have a relationship where you're free to burden one another with that repulsive self-gratification...I know that it's out of the question! I know that it's out of my reach! Even so!"" Even so, I... I want something genuine.

You can’t take back the answer you already gave out. There’s no use in crying over spilt milk. The egg you broke won’t come back. All the horses and soldiers of a king will never return to his side again. It doesn’t matter what was said. You can never wipe away a bad impression. Even though the opposite is so simple in comparison. Just one word will make someone appear hateful. Just doing one thing would make you seem hateful. That’s why excuses are meaningless. Because even those excuses will make you look hateful.,Hachiman Hikigaya
A problem is not a problem as long as nobody sees it as one.,Hachiman Hikigaya
There is a history to humans. Humans are shaped by the experience obtained from living as time continued to wind and wind. To be reborn meant being rid of that history; complete annihilation. However, that just wasn’t possible in reality. That’s why the only thing you could do was to continue living on, bearing the scars on your body and holding the weight of the sins on your back, without wishing for reincarnation.
--Hachiman Hikigaya
When people reach the halfway mark of a long ordeal, how do they feel? Does being only halfway there make them despair? Or do they feel relief at making it halfway there? Most people have to feel one way or the other, and both emotions create an opening in their hearts. That's why I pushed myself this far.
--Hachiman Hikigaya
If failure is the hallmark of being young, like they say. then someone who has failed to make friends must be at the peak of his youth, right? However, I'm sure they will disagree. All of this is just their double standards at play and nothing else. Here's the bottom line: Fools that enjoy their youth should go kill themselves.
--Hachiman Hikigaya
Working hard alone doesn't assure you that you'll achieve your dreams. Actually there are more cases where you don't. Even so, working hard and achieving something is some consolation at least.
--Hachiman Hikigaya
Marriage, the institution where one's existence goes to die. All married people prattle on about their so-called marital bliss about how they love saying ""I'm home!"" to their spouses, or how seeing their sleeping kids motivates them for tomorrow. But think about it: you can say ""I'm home!"" if you live your parents, you can even buy some mouthwash and say ""I'm home!"" to the hippos on the label. And if they're talking about seeing their sleeping kids, that just means they're working hellish overtime hours. How is that in any way blissful?
--Hachiman Hikigaya
What if, and this is strictly hypothetical, what if you could reload your save data to change your previous choice, like in a game? Would it change your life? The answer is a resounding no.

If they're not given a problem, if they're unable to find a reason, some people can't bring themselves to act. Maybe I got something wrong somewhere. Only that bit of doubt stayed with me.

So, yeah. Strong animals don’t gather in herds or anything like that. Do they not know the expression “a lone wolf”? Cats are cute and wolves are cool. In other words, loners are cute and cool.

Do you know the phrase “enough specks of dust creates a mountain”? Or maybe “three heads are better than one.” In other words, when people gathered together, they become even stronger and more secure. However, we were a group of failures who had gathered to do pointless things.

If wishes could be granted, if desires could be fulfilled, then I wouldn't wish or desire for anything after all. The things you're handed on a silver platter are never genuine, and never everlasting. And that is why I'll always keep searching.

School trips are simply a simulation of adult social life. If you ever go on a business trip with your boss, you won't get to choose where to stay or what to eat, but if you compromise, you can still have a modicum of fun. School trips train you to trick yourself into that kinda mindset.

I lie all the time. Who cares if you know something, but you say you don't? Forcing something out of someone without permission is worse.
--Hachiman Hikigaya
There are no inherently bad people. Everyone believes that, myself included. I don’t doubt the existence of virtue. And yet people bare their fangs when it seems they can profit. People will rationalize their own behavior whenever they become tainted with evil; they’re not supposed to be evil. In order to preserve their own twisted integrity, the world becomes twisted. Someone you praised as “cool” until yesterday is “stuck up” today; someone you respected as “smart and knowledgeable” is now scorned as someone who “looks down on bad students”, and “energetic vigor” becomes “annoying and overly carried away”.
--Hachiman Hikigaya
There are people who can't act unless they're faced with a problem. Unless they find their reason. All I was left with was the sinking suspicion that I'd gone horribly wrong.,Hachiman Hikigaya
Walls are an unavoidable part of youth.,Hachiman Hikigaya
People who grow up in different environments will invariably have different tastes and preferences. Therefore, could one say that the subsequent marriages necessarily lead to happiness?
--Hachiman Hikigaya
About marriage or about future, I don't know what will happen in the future. In this world, it's normal that when there's a preparation, then a new grief is born, but everyone has the right to desire happiness. Our efforts need to be held for the sake of our future.

Really, what a joke. I just didn’t understand what these nice guys were thinking about. Because they were so in love with everyone getting along, they ended up opening up other problems when they try to fix one. I didn’t even ask to be thrown into that circle either.

Being a detective isn't about bringing someone down, but rather protecting someone.
--Shinya Kougami
I'm sorry. I couldn't keep my promise. I wanted to go into a line of work where I could protect people. That's why I became a detective. But Makishima changed everything. That man will continue to kill people. And yet, the law can't judge him. As long as I'm a detective, I can't touch him. This case made me aware... that the law can't protect people.

It's not a matter of real or fake. These avatars are idols on the net. in other words - icons. Icons cannot solely exist through their own will. Neither Hayama nor Sugawara established their status on their own. They were able to become Talsiman and Spooky Boogie because their fans idolized them based on their own distorted perceptions. Their true feelings and colors are not the same as the ideals their characters represents. It's not surprising that a fan could do a better job than the real owners of playing the idol the fans expect to see.,Shinya Kougami
A beautiful flower too will eventually wither and fall. That's the fate of all living beings. If that's the case, it's only natural for one to want to stop the time while they're still blossoming in all full glory.

Overall, I think people tend to reveal their true selves when they step into an avatar. As I said earlier, they probably feel some sense of freedom. But freedom easily gained quickly turns into a false sense of omnipotence.
--Shougo Makishima
Most people don’t mind killing cows and chickens but they’d probably have a hard time doing the same to chimpanzees. Partially, it’s because chimpanzees bear a slight resemblance to humans, but the primary reason is that they can draw pictures. Suppose fish were able to draw pictures. Even if we are unable to understand what they’re thinking, it becomes harder to kill animals that can draw. Instinctively, in our minds we would say to ourselves… “May be they have feelings” That shows how high a value we assign to expression.
--Shougo Makishima
Suppose someone said ""humans are foolish""... Obviously, that person would be talking about themselves as well. If you want to understand human beings, you need to do more than just watch them. You need to pay attention to what they themselves are watching. What are you watching? You are the ones who I'm watching. It may be hard to believe, but I like you guys. You know what they say... The opposite of love is not hatred, but indifference. An indifferent person would lack the drive to kill or hurt. My mind keeps jumping around. Am I nervous...? Did I underestimate my enemy so much that I stepped in too deep...? ...What a silly thought.
--Shougo Makishima
Aging is quite similar to death. Some people stand up to aging and death as if it were nothing. They can do it not because they're braver than others, but simply because they lack imagination. Only once people deny that which they love, do they become able to create it anew. Perhaps, the book I write, too, will die one day just like my body will. However, people have to accept that death is unavoidable. They will probably be gone in ten years. Their books will no longer exist in a hundred years. People accept this. Eternity is promised neither to humans nor to books. We live because we were born. If the system possesses the power of life and death over you... you're no longer a human. You're livestock. No matter how hard a rancher tries to pretend otherwise, they never recognize their livestock as friends. It's a mystery to me... How is it that these people, treated as livestock in this boring society, have not tried at all to destroy it? Nothing in this world is eternal. The only thing that truly exists is the splendor of the souls that atone for their sins.
--Shougo Makishima
The opposite of boredom is not pleasure... but excitement. People will gladly seek out any kind of excitement, even pain.

A perfect plan doesn't mean having everything go within expectations. A perfect plan is achieved when it has the plasticity needed to flexibly deal with troubles.,Shougo Makishima
In order to measure a person’s worth, you must do more than push them. The real way to test their worth is to give them power. When they gain the freedom to act outside the boundaries of law and ethics, you can sometimes see their souls. When the weak become strong... When good citizens become free to engage in violence... I'm interested to see what is the outcome of that.

I just long for a world in which ordinary things are done in an ordinary way.,Shougo Makishima
For some time researchers have understood that moderate stress has beneficial effects. It boosts the immune system for example. Stress motivates and prepares us for action. It compels our body to survive. However, routine psycho pass checks take away the stress from us. There are patients whose stress reaction is so numb, they can’t even recognize the basic stimulation of their senses. Once that happens, it’s a neurological downward spiral, they become like living corpses. Eventually their autonomic nervous system stops working and their vital functions shut down.

You sure say some funny things. Solitude? Does that only apply to me? Who isn't alone in this society? The time when our connection to others was the basis of our selves is long gone. In this world where everyone is watched over by the system and live within the system's standards, a community isn't necessary. Everyone just lives in their own cell, and the system tames them by giving them each their own personal serenity.

The law doesn't protect people. People protect the law. People have always detested evil and sought out a righteous way of living.

Don't be upset because of what you can't do. Do what you do best, live as carefree and optimistically as you can, because some people aren't able to do that.
--Keima Katsuragi
None of that will ever happen. I hate myself! But still, I have to keep these fantasies going! If I have a thousand of them, at least one of them might come true one day. If you stop fantasizing, you have no choice but to be crushed by reality.
--Eita Kidou
Was I able to live inside someone’s heart? Was I able to live inside your heart? Do you think you’ll remember me at least a little? You’d better not hit ""reset!"" Don’t forget me, okay? That’s a promise, okay? I'm glad it’s you, after all. Will I reach you? I hope I can reach you.
--Kaori Miyazono
Maybe there’s only a dark road up ahead. But you still have to believe and keep going. Believe that the stars will light your path, even a little bit.
--Kaori Miyazono
You're you. ""To be like you..."" - it's not so ambiguous as that. No matter what you do, no matter how you change, it doesn't mean a thing. you're just you, no matter what.
--Kaori Miyazono
So ephemeral and weak. But its shining with all its might. Thump, Thump, like a heartbeat. This is the light of life.
--Kaori Miyazono
After the first note resonated through the hall, You became everything I yearn for.
--Kaori Miyazono
Such a cruel boy. Telling me to dream one more time. I thought I was satisfied because my dream had come true... And I'd told myself it was enough... Yet here you are, watering this withered heart again.
--Kaori Miyazono
We’re all afraid, you know.. to get up on stage. Maybe you’ll mess up. Maybe they’ll totally reject you. Even so, you grit your teeth and get up on stage anyway. Something compels us… moves us to play music.
--Kaori Miyazono
By exchanging notes, you get to know one another, to understand one another. As if your souls were connected and your hearts were overlapping. It's a conversation through instruments. A miracle that creates harmony. In that moment, music transcends words.
--Kaori Miyazono
If you can't move with your hands then play with your feet! If you don't have enough fingers, then use your nose as well! Whether you're sad, you're a mess, or you've hit rock bottom, you still have to play! That's how people like us survive.
--Kaori Miyazono
Music is freedom.,Kaori Miyazono
Didn't you know... girls are greedy?,Kaori Miyazono
Setbacks are inevitable to superstars. Adversity is what separates the good from the great. After all, stars can only shine during the night.
--Ryouta Watari
It's only natural for the girl you're crushing on to be in love with someone else. Since you're in love with her, she sparkles in your eyes. That's why people fall so irrationally in love.
--Ryouta Watari
We're all connected. Just like the notes are intermittently connected. It's shared by us all. Through music, with the people you know, with the people you don't know, with all the people in this world.
--Hiroko Seto
It's not just allies who support each other. From your enemies, you learn so much and gain so much. Until the day you meet again... Just knowing they exist helps you to withstand the loneliness. Those who compete, even if they're enemies, help each other out.
--Hiroko Seto
Defiance toward parents is an establishment of one's self; it's a sign of independence.,Hiroko Seto
As a musician, in the process of learning from a teacher, your differences breed a sense of discomfort which you should cherish. It's because of those differences that we have individuality.
--Hiroko Seto
When you say you ""can't hear the sound"
-- doesn't it really mean you ""aren't restrained by the sound""? Rather than the sound you hear with your ears, an image inside you is boiling up from the depths of yourself and taking over without you even knowing. The sound inside, the landscape in your heart, your wishes, a sound loaded with your thoughts; didn't you feel it, even for a moment? ""Not being able to hear the sound."" That is a gift.
--Hiroko Seto
Spring will be here soon. Spring, the season I met you, is coming. A Spring without you...is coming.
--Kousei Arima
A lump of steel, like a shooting star. Just seeing the same sky as you makes familiar scenery look different. I swing between hope and despair at your slightest gesture, and my heart starts to play a melody. What kind of feeling is this again? What do they call this kind of feeling? I think it's probably... Called Love. I'm sure this is what they call love.
--Kousei Arima
Isn't it funny how the most unforgettable scenes can be so trivial ?,Kousei Arima
Hold on. Don't go! Let's argue again. I'll bribe you with a canelé. I'll call you to kill time. I don't mind being Friend A. Please don't go. Please don't go. Please don't go...please don't leave me behind.,Kousei Arima
Maybe... just maybe, the light can reach even the bottom of a dark ocean.
--Kousei Arima
Sure I'm okay. Because that's how I was built, after all.
--Kousei Arima
The piano is meant to be played like you're embracing it, right?
--Kousei Arima
I want to hear it again, yet I don't want to hear it again. I want to see her, yet I don't want to see her. What do you call this kind of feeling again?
--Kousei Arima
Music speaks louder than words.,Kousei Arima
I look like I'm suffering, huh? That's not good... But of course I'd be suffering. I mean, I'm gonna sail in uncharted waters, right? Both, taking on a challenge and creating something. It is painful, but it's fulfilling.
--Kousei Arima
Even in the depths of the darkest oceans, some light always pierces through.
--Kousei Arima
You know, I discovered something. Everyone has something... Something deep inside their hearts. For some, it might have been enmity. For others, admiration. Wishes, a craving for the spotlight, feelings that one wants to deliver, feelings for one's mother. Everyone was supported by their own feelings. I realize now that, perhaps, no one can stand alone on stage.
--Kousei Arima
The more I concentrate, the more I get consumed by my performance. The sounds I play fade away from my reach, tangling up like flowers seized by the spring wind and vanish.
--Kousei Arima
But I wasn't slacking at all. I practiced till I passed out. I gave my all. And if I still turned in a sloppy performance after all that, then... That's who I am now. It's the current me, playing with everything I've got.
--Kousei Arima
I don't like this, I don't like this, I don't like this. Sure, I know that I have no right to be feeling this way. But I still don't like it! I just don't like it. We were always together. I was always by his side. During time of joy, and grief as well. But...I realize he's far away from me now... I'm not by his side...there's somebody else there... I don't like this! Look at me! Look at me, will you? Not with those eyes... Don't look at someone else!
--Tsubaki Sawabe
Even though I'm bitter over losing, even though I'm depressed, even though my ankle hurts, and my eyes are smeared with tears...even though I've never felt worse...I wonder why the stars are sparkling like this. The scent of the music room in his hair. I can hear his slightly ragged breathing. His shoulder, wet with tears, is so warm. I am by his side. I wish time would just stand still.
--Tsubaki Sawabe
The future is always blank. Only your willpower can leave footsteps there.,Satoru Fujinuma
""Believing in someone."" That's a weird phrase, isn't it? After all, if you truly believed in a person, you wouldn't need to say, ""I believe you."" It's like saying, ""I believe in air."" I don't mean to say that ""believing in something"" is like a lie. ""Believing"" is really a term of hope of wanting to believe.
--Satoru Fujinuma
While I'm performing it feels like it'll become real somewhere along the line.,Kayo Hinazuki
When I get bigger, big enough to go somewhere by myself, I want to go to a land that’s far away. I want to go to a faraway island. I want to go to an island that has no people. I want to go to an island that has no pain or sadness. There are no adults, children, classmates, teachers or my mom on that island. On that island, I can climb a tree when I want to climb, swim in the sea when I want to swim, and sleep when I want to sleep. In the island, I think about the town that I left behind. Kids go to school, as if nothing has changed. Adults go to the office, as if nothing has changed. Mom eats, as if nothing has changed. When I think about the town without me, I feel a sense of relief. I want to go far, far away.
--Kayo Hinazuki
I'll give you some wise words, Shining Sleepless General. All heroes die of overwork.
--Ikta Solork
If you think unconditional kindness is good, and any sort of kindness that comes with conditions is hypocrisy, you should reconsider. People can only achieve as much as the situation allows.
--Ikta Solork
People started growing crops because going hunting without knowing if you'd catch anything was a pain. People dug wells because going all the way to the river was a pain. Laziness is the mother of human progress.,Ikta Solork
Chasing someone is tiring, and being chased is mentally exhausting. But making someone chase you can be fun.
--Ikta Solork
A barbarian punches someone when he feels like it, a soldier attacks when it's time to attack, and Ikta Solork says everything he wants whenever he wants to say it.
--Ikta Solork
Forgetting is like a wound. 
The wound may heal 
but it has already left a scar.

Being alone is more painful than getting hurt.,Monkey D. Luffy

I'll take fragments from the chaos of this world... and using the fountain of wisdom inside me, will reconstruct them into truth.

On the one hand, humans seek out new stimuli with insatiable desire. On the other, they're also odd creatures that value old and very rare things.

Never trust anyone too much, remember the devil was once an angel.
--Kaneki Ken
Why is it that the beautiful things are entwined more deeply with death than with life?,Kaneki Ken
It's better to be hurt than to hurt others. Nice people can be happy with just that.,Kaneki Ken
What's wrong isn't me, what's wrong is the world!
--Kaneki Ken
I was wrong. I wasn't eating ghouls. I'm the one who was being eaten.,Kaneki Ken
Human relationships are chemical reactions. If you have a reaction then you can never return back to your previous state of being.,Kaneki Ken
You're wrong. It's not the world that's messed up; it's those of us in it. Yes, some ghouls walk a path that leaves sorrow in their wake, but just like humans, we can choose a different path all together. We have a lot to learn, both your kind and mine. We need to stop fighting, and start talking. Because when it comes to the state of the world, you can't point your finger at ghouls or humans. We're all to blame.
--Kaneki Ken
As my fingers and toes re-grew like fingernails or hair over and over and over and over... and over again, every single time I got the feeling that I truly, truly truly was a monster.
--Kaneki Ken
You think something like that would hurt, after all I've been through?
--Kaneki Ken
I'm begging you, don't make me a killer!
--Kaneki Ken
If you were to write a story with me in the lead role, it would certainly be... a tragedy.
--Kaneki Ken
There are times when you have to give up on one thing to preserve the other. Your mother couldn't. That isn't kindness. That's just being weak.,Rize Kamishiro
All of the disadvantage in this world stems from a person's lack of ability.,Rize Kamishiro
Whose fault is it that things ended up like this? Coincidence? An accident? Fate? There's no such thing as fate. It's simply a combination of one circumstance and the next. And who is it that creates those circumstances? Who is it? It's you.,Rize Kamishiro
Why should I apologize for being a monster? Has anyone ever apologized for turning me into one?,Juuzou Suzuya
If an angelic being fell from the sky and tried to live in this world of ours, I think even they would commit many wrongs.
--Juuzou Suzuya
There's no way someone who can't even protect himself can protect anyone else, is there?

After you've gobbled him down you'd be left alone to regret it while covered in blood and guts. That's the hunger of a ghoul. That's our destiny.,Touka Kirishima
All we can do is live while losing things.,Renji Yomo
Books are nice, aren't they? With just one sentence you can get lost in all sorts of dreams. They way I think of it, literature allows the reader's consciousness to deeply relish the author and be closer to him. And so, we freely walk around the world of the story from the yarn spinner's point of view. It's only when you immerse yourself in the world of a book that you are able to forget just who you are.
--Shuu Tsukiyama
Isn't it arrogant to put a price on whether life is ""higher"" or ""lower"
-- Kaneki? We are just bags of meat. The weak bow down and the strong devour them. Rather, if you compared them to all living things, it's humans who have shaved away the most lives. We are different than them.
--Shuu Tsukiyama
You don't need to blame yourself just because you've hurt someone, just like when you're walking you can't really blame yourself to crush some ants... that's what being stronger ones means.
--Shuu Tsukiyama
I'm not going to protect you by being your shield or armor, but I'll be the dagger hidden below your pillow.
--Shuu Tsukiyama
I know I haven't always made the right decisions up to now... Whether I was right, or whether I was wrong, may not even matter in the first place. However, running up against my sins like this-- all of the choices I've made up to this point-- today, being able to die for someone-- is something I'm glad for...
--Irimi Kaya
Sometimes good people make bad choices. It doesn't mean they are bad people. It means they're human.,Kishou Arima
As long as it's for the right cause, there's nothing wrong with playing dirty.

A castle that vanishes at the first gust of wind is worthless. A skyscraper within your mind will never fall down.,Satsuki Kiryuuin
I understand now. The world is not cut from the same cloth. It is because it is overflowing with inexplicable, unidentifiable things that the world is so beautiful.

Those who lack resolve are incapable of even wiping away their own tears.,Satsuki Kiryuuin

Doing what one likes is the right of the powerful.,Yakumo Oomori
It's not because we can't take vengeance that we should feel sorry. The real reason to feel sorry... is when one is hung up on revenge and can't live their own life.,Yoshimura
We're always trying to justify our actions with ideals. But ideals cannot give grounds for killing another person. The act of taking a life will always be considered... evil.,Yoshimura
...The act of taking is equally evil. We, from the moment of birth, continue to take. Food, connections, even fellow blood. Living to utmost. Continuing to slaughter, kill, take. Life is to constantly sin. Life is evil itself. I am aware I am evil... And so are you all. Now, come kill me. And I shall do the same!
--Yoshimura
If at some point in life, you made a mistake or keep failing over and over again, and you can't help but think it's useless and you're a good for nothing; Remember, you're only taking a detour. And I'm sure further along your path will come a day where you think, ""It was a good life experience"". That's why it'll be fine.
--Hishiro Chizuru
Maybe worrying about the future partings so much that you miss out on happiness in the present is a waste.,Hishiro Chizuru
If I can't even manage a polite smile,
I'll be in trouble in the real world.
--Hishiro Chizuru
The more fun I have, the more it'll hurt when we part ways. I know that all too well.
--Hishiro Chizuru
I don't understand what I say that makes people so mad. I don't understand how they feel. I know that's because I haven't properly socialized, I've tried to learn. I've tried to study up on it, but I just don't know what's right.
--Hishiro Chizuru
I want to defeat the me that's dragging this failure around. I don't want to forget my failure. But if I carry it with me as a bad memory and keep running away, I will never change.
--Hishiro Chizuru
If I don't understand how a friend feels, am I not allowed to worry about them? If I don't experience what you do, am I not allowed to worry about you, my friend?
--Hishiro Chizuru
It's easy to say ""choose so that you'll have no regrets,"" but that's impossible. No matter how hard you've agonized over your path, you'll always regret something about it later. That's just how we humans are made. Which is why I think our true feelings are important. If you choose your path based on your true feelings, it'll hurt just a little less when you feel the same regret, right?
--Glenn Radars
I led me by the hand, as if to fill the niches in the memories in my oozing brain fluid. Without even a destination, we kept walking. Disgusting clouds were floating in the sky. I already know what will happen to me the next time I wake up.

If you're the kind of person who can devote herself like that to someone, then I'll bet you there's someone out there who'll fall in love with you.

I really hate it when I miss you so much and I can't do anything about it.,Kosaki Onodera
I couldn't bring myself to ask again... I'm such a fool.,Kosaki Onodera
Why did you run away, Chitoge-chan? No... I don't want this... I won't be happy with you just giving up... To end up liking the same person. It's painful, for sure but Chitoge-chan, you like him enough to not be able to face him again after that, don't you? Regardless of who ends up with him, I want to be satisfied when it happens. I thought for sure that you think the same way. Is there a reason why that can't happen? Tell me Chitoge-chan...

Oh? What are you surprised about!? Do you think that I'm someone who would give up after being rejected just once!? Hospitalized or not, I shall continue to polish myself and become even moooore of a spectacular lady, and return to you!!

I won't come to hate you! Never! Regardless of what happens in the future!,Marika Tachibana
Holding in your own feelings like that... you think that no one's gonna get hurt since you're not letting it show to anyone? That's just the same as going around hurting everyone anyway!! What you're doing isn't you keeping everyone dear to you!! You're just protecting yourself!!! You're just afraid of getting hurt! Losing your nerve! You're just scared!!,Marika Tachibana
From here on, I'm going to make sure you don't forget me!

Real pain is the result of losing someone you care about.,Kazuto Kirigaya
Everybody can fight. It's just a choice of whether you should.,Kazuto Kirigaya
The main reason I got stronger was so I’d be able to survive.,Kazuto Kirigaya
Whether here or in the real world, you can cry when it hurts. There's no rule that you can't show feelings just because it's a game.
--Kazuto Kirigaya
If that bullet could also kill a player in the real world, and if you didn't shoot them, you or someone you loved would be killed, could you still pull the trigger?
--Kazuto Kirigaya
There's no meaningful difference between a real and a virtual world. It is pointless to question who someone really is. All you can do is believe and accept. Because the way you perceive someone is their true identity.,Kazuto Kirigaya

If we make it back to the real world, I'll find you.

--Asuna Yuuki
I cried alone every single night. It felt like every day that passed here stole another piece of my real life away. After I cried, I'd go and fight as hard as I could. My only thought was winning, moving forward and getting stronger.
--Asuna Yuuki
I was just dreaming a little. About my old world. It's strange. In the dream, I wondered if everything here, in Aincard, if everything that had happened with you, was only a dream. I was really scared. I'm happy this wasn't a dream.

--Madara Uchiha
When a man learns to love,
he must bear the risk of hatred.
--Madara Uchiha
In this world, wherever there is light - there are also shadows. As long as the concept of winners exists, there must also be losers. The selfish desire of wanting to maintain peace causes wars, and hatred is born to protect love.
--Madara Uchiha
Man seeks peace, yet at the same time yearning for war... Those are the two realms belonging solely to man. Thinking of peace whilst spilling blood is something that only humans could do. They're two sides of the same coin... to protect something... another must be sacrificed.

I'm no one. I don't want to be anyone. All I care about is completing the moon's eye plan. This world is completely worthless. There is nothing left in it but misery.,Obito Uchiha
Somewhere inside of me?! Take a good look, there's nothing inside of me anymore!!! I don't feel pain, I don't feel anything! You need to let that guilt go Kakashi. This wind hole wasn't your doing... It was made by this evil, cruel world.
--Obito Uchiha
*to Kakashi* I'm about to... die... but I'll become your eye.,Obito Uchiha

I want to see and understand the world outside.
I don't want to die inside these walls

[referring to a group of thugs] I disposed of some dangerous beasts. Mere animals that just happened to resemble humans.,Eren Jaeger
If you win, you live.
If you lose, you die.
If you don't fight, you can't win!
--Eren Jaeger
On that day, mankind received a grim reminder. We lived in fear of the titans, and were disgraced to live in these cages we called walls.
--Eren Jaeger
If you think reality is just living comfortably and following your own whims, can you seriously dare to call yourself a soldier?
--Eren Jaeger
Only victors are allowed to live...
this world is merciless like that.
--Mikasa Ackerman
That's right... This world... is cruel.
It hit me that living was like a miracle.
--Mikasa Ackerman
Once I'm dead,
I won't even be able to remember you.
So I'll win, no matter what.
I'll live, no matter what!
--Mikasa Ackerman
I am strong.
Stronger than all of you.
Extremely strong.
I can kill all the titans out there.
Even if I am alone.
--Mikasa Ackerman
You're either incompetent or you're spineless cowards.
How pathetic.
You can just sit here and suck on your fingers.
Yeah, do that.
--Mikasa Ackerman
This world is merciless,
and it's also very beautiful.
--Mikasa Ackerman
You don't stand a single chance to win, unless you fight.
--Mikasa Ackerman
There are only so many lives I can value. And...I decided who those people were six years ago. So...You shouldn't try to ask for my pity. Because right now, I don't have...Time to spare or room in my heart.
--Mikasa Ackerman
If you think it's natural for people to sacrifice their own lives to save others, surely you understand that sometimes a single death can save many lives.
--Mikasa Ackerman
The lesson you need to learn right now, can't be taught with words... only with action.
--Levi Ackerman
A lot of the times, you're going into a situation you know nothing about. So what you need is to be quick to act... and make tough decisions in worst-case scenarios.
--Levi Ackerman
If you don't want to die - think.,Levi Ackerman
The difference between your decision and ours is experience. But you don't have to rely on that. CHOOSE... Believe in yourself, or believe in the survey corps and me. I don't know... I never have. I can believe in my own abilities or the choices of the companions I trust. But no one ever knows how it will turn out. So choose for yourself, whichever decision you will regret the least.
--Levi Ackerman
I don't know which option you should choose. I could never advise you on that... No matter what kind of wisdom dictates you the option you pick, no one will be able to tell if it's right or wrong until you arrive to some sort of outcome from your choice.
--Levi Ackerman
I think the best disciplining is pain.,Levi Ackerman
The difference in judgement between you and me, originates from different rules derived from past experience.
--Levi Ackerman
The only thing we're allowed to do... is to believe that we won't regret the choice we made.,Levi Ackerman
This is just my opinion, but when it comes to teaching somebody discipline... I believe pain is the most effective way.
--Levi Ackerman
You're only resorting to physical abuse because you can't prove that I'm wrong.,Armin Arlelt

We're going to explore the outside world someday, right? Far beyond these walls, there's flaming water, land made of ice, and fields of sand spread wide. It's the world my parents wanted to go to.
--Armin Arlelt
People are crazy for believing that these walls will protect us forever. Even though the walls have been intact for the past 100 years, there’s nothing that can guarantee they won’t be broken down today…
--Armin Arlelt
I was, I am, and I remain a soldier, sworn to devote my heart and soul to the restoration of humankind! There is no greater glory than than dying for that belief!
--Armin Arlelt
You can't change anything unless you can discard part of yourself too. To surpass monsters, you must be willing to abandon your humanity.
--Armin Arlelt
I don't like the terms ""good person"" or ""bad person"" because it's impossible to be entirely good to everyone or entirely bad to everyone. To some, you are a good person, while to others, you are a bad person.
--Armin Arlelt
Everyone can make a choice after they have learned what it will result in. It is so easy to say we should have done it this way afterwards. But you can't know what your choice will result in before actually choosing.,Armin Arlelt
I haven't lived all that long yet, but there is something I firmly believe in. The people who have the ability to change something in this world, all without exception, have the guts to abandon things important to them if they have to. They are those who can abandon even their humanity.
--Armin Arlelt
People who can't throw something important away, can never hope to change anything.
--Armin Arlelt
The people who have the ability to change something in this world, all, without exception, have guts to abandon things important to them if they have to.

The strong feed upon weak. It's such an obligingly simple rule. Except in this world, my friends tried to be strong.

Sometimes you have days like this. Days where the most trivial little thing... Ends up getting you wrapped up in some big, annoying trouble.
--Annie Leonhart
What must be done... Must be done. No matter what. Complete your mission. You were born into this world so that you could complete your mission.,Annie Leonhart
I just want the weak, who do get swept along with the flow, be considered human too.
--Annie Leonhart
You are saying that innately, all people are good, and if they were to just assume their nature, this organization wouldn't be so rotten, right? But in my opinion, the structure of the organization, the way it is set up is what provides insight into what the true human nature really is.
--Annie Leonhart
Going against the flow... takes a lot of courage. I respect that. Maybe people who can do it are just stupid, but... Well... What I'm sure of is that people like that are rare. So you can't call them common. You can't call them normal, either. People like you... get called special.
--Annie Leonhart
All day, I've had to sit in the stench of cigarettes and alcohol. Every single person I met today was drinking and smoking. If they weren't, they were doing drugs. Well, except for Wayne. I've... had enough of it.

I want everyone to feel safe again soon...I want this to be a world where people can without fighting each other.,Hange Zoe
Even in moments of the deepest despair... I guess we can still find hope, huh?
--Hange Zoe
Even if all we accomplished were small steps forward... We continued to give our lives if it meant that one day... humanity would be free from this terror.,Hange Zoe
Ever since I joined the survey corps, I've had people dying on me everyday. But... you understand, don't you? One day or another, everyone you care about eventually dies. It's something we simply can't accept. It's a realization that could drive you insane... It's painful... so painful... I get it. And still... we must keep moving forward.
--Hange Zoe
If there's something you don't understand, learn to understand it.

If you've got energy to spend on feeling guilty, then use it to show your gratitude.
--Yuuji Kazami
Compared to failing without even trying, I'd rather take action, even at the risk of a mistake.
--Yuuji Kazami
No matter what you're doing, the most essential thing is to not give up. Fail as many times as it takes. Keep trying persistantly untill you can call yourself 'avarage'. If you can collect a nice group of avarage-level skills, that's already above-avarage. You've created your own sort of 'talent'.
--Yuuji Kazami
There are only two times when a man can cry in public: when he loses his wallet and when his mother dies. And even if you cry in private, there's a severe restriction. Shed tears for others. The only thing you should be shedding for yourself is sweat. Remember that.
--Yuuji Kazami
Skilled only at making excuses that justify nothing, he is someone whose life has no value. The same goes for me. I have the right to stop you because I'm just like you.
--Yuuji Kazami
To ensure that all I've done won't end up a lie. I don't want to talk big game to people, then run away when it matters the most. This is a wall I must overcome on my own. If there's anything I want to change, I have to change myself. If I must become evil to defeat evil, I will become the devil himself. That's all to it.
--Yuuji Kazami
A little bit of trouble keeps life from being boring.,Yuuji Kazami
They say you never know when a bullet you fired in battle will find its way back to you.,Yuuji Kazami
This is something my master used to say. ""Kids who are too obedient and never think of themselves are the hardest to watch.""

At that point in my life, I couldn't find any value in anything. I was a brat who may as well be dead.
--Yuuji Kazami
Colors and lies both get blacker as you add more. Add enough red, and it'll turn black too.
--Yuuji Kazami
At this point, no matter how I change, the things I've lost won't come back.
--Yuuji Kazami
According to my master, when you're a kid, just being a fast runner makes you popular. In middle school, it's holding your own in a fight. After that, brains make you popular. Her point seemed to be, ""Run fast, hit hard, and read books.""
--Yuuji Kazami
Lies are like colours. The more you pile up, the blacker things get.
--Yuuji Kazami
Life comes at a cost. Wouldn’t it be arrogant to die before you’ve repaid that debt?,Yuuji Kazami
In this world, when you face forward, that's the future. When you look back, it's a memory. And if you clip a part of it out, that becomes a story.
--Yuuji Kazami
Being indebted to someone is nothing to be ashamed of. Not repaying that debt is.,Yuuji Kazami
I was feeling down, but you distracted me by subjecting me to your selfish whims. There are times when selfishness can save a person.

There are always lazy people to deal with when you act as a group. Splitting into pairs and handling out jobs is more efficient.,Kazuki Kazami
I believe that ""I could have done something"" is the most frustrating regret of them all.

If I'm around you, I don't think I'll ever be bored.
--Tomoya Okazaki
If you feel like crying you should not hold back your tears. You should let it all out while you still can - because when you get bigger sometimes you can't cry even if you have something to cry about.,Tomoya Okazaki
The days I spent with you were a lot of fun. I realized for the first time that it makes me so happy to be needed by others. I thought I'd get along well with you like this. But I can't. I was being a jerk. While I was with you, I was looking at someone else. I kept it to myself even after realizing that. I was taking advantage of your kindness.
--Tomoya Okazaki
The city is changing. Our surroundings, and even ourselves. And then one day, just about everything will change…
--Tomoya Okazaki
What are you so hesitant about? It’s your dream, isn’t it? It’s right in front of you and you’re wavering? You gotta be reckless, and take whatever you can!
--Tomoya Okazaki
You are who you are. You have to do what you can.,Tomoya Okazaki
I hate this town. It’s too filled with memories I’d rather forget. I go to school every day, hang out with my friends, and then go home. There’s no place I’d rather not go ever again. I wonder if anything will ever change? Will that day ever come?
--Tomoya Okazaki
Isn’t it fine as long as you find it? Isn’t it fine as long as you find the next fun and happy moments again?,Tomoya Okazaki
Do not lose to the obstacles that you will meet in the future. I have my own set of goals but do not pursue them because of my laziness.,Tomoya Okazaki
You should cry while you still can. When you get bigger, sometimes, you can't cry even if you have something you wanna cry about.
--Tomoya Okazaki
I've already decided. Getting good grades and listening to teachers can take me somewhere high and far away, but what if that's not where I want to go? Right here, by your side, Tomoya, is the only place I want to be.
--Tomoyo Sakagami
Time and titles do not matter in the bonds between people.,Tomoyo Sakagami
No matter how cold and distant people may become, on the inside something warm and precious always remains, something that never changes. To me, that’s what family is like.
--Tomoyo Sakagami
Meeting you was the best thing that ever happened to me. You made me so happy. I don’t want you to be lost or afraid or anything like that. From here on out, I know things might be hard sometimes. But no matter what may await, please don’t regret meeting me.
--Nagisa Furukawa
If you can move on, then you should.

Nothing can stay unchanged. Fun things… Happy things… They can’t possibly remain the same.,Nagisa Furukawa
You shouldn’t stop like that. If you can move forward, then you should.

I, Okazaki Nagisa, will no longer cry. No matter what painful things I face, I’ll hang in there and overcome it. But, I might cry during moments of happiness. I hope that you can get along… with someone like me.

Isn’t there something strange in becoming friends because you’re asked? Friends aren’t given; you’re supposed to make them.,Kyou Fujibayashi
If the results come true, it's as if there's only one future. If it fails, we can think that other futures exist... I want to believe that in our future there are many possibilities waiting.
--Kyou Fujibayashi
Please don’t apologize. If you did, and I forgave you, then it’d be like it was all a lie. I want to hold those memories we had dear. The fun times… The painful times… All of it. So please, don’t apologize.
--Ryou Fujibayashi
If a prediction is right, then it's like you only have one future. Like that future has been decided. But if it's wrong, then you have an almost infinite number of possibilities. And that means that even the tiniest twist of fate can change your future. I want to believe that I have choices - that the path I walk has many different turns, and many different roads to follow!
--Ryou Fujibayashi
Being unable to trust anything is the same as being unable to sense other people's love.,Yusuke Yoshino
Keep on living your life in such a way that love doesn't fade away. I shall work... so that love may shine brightly, even today.

He realized that he had lost sight of something important. No matter what turn he took he should have kept singing. Even if his songs couldn’t save the world, he could still sing songs for her. Don’t ever lose sight of what’s important to you.
--Yusuke Yoshino
What’s important is not losing sight of your path.,Yusuke Yoshino
Children, this is the only gift I can give you right now. A formless gift you call a memory. I don’t have any money and I can’t give you something tangible. But even so, even if it isn’t tangible, a memory is something that will continue to be with you. That is what I believe…
--Yusuke Yoshino
Everyone makes mistakes. What's important is how to make up for it.,Yusuke Yoshino
At a place where you feel most restful… Next to the person you find most dear. People's lives are repetitions of inflicting pain on each other. It's understandable to doubt others. But being unable to trust anything is the same as being unable to feel other people's love. Aren’t you, perhaps, feeling lonely? Aren’t you, perhaps, living slavishly? Are you able to laugh with an honest heart?
--Yusuke Yoshino
It’s natural that men have things they need to protect.,Akio Furukawa
We didn’t give up on our dreams! We changed our dreams into your dream! That’s what parents do! That’s what a family does!,Akio Furukawa
Those who seek out the truth must not be arrogant. You must not laugh at miracles just because they cannot be explained scientifically. You must not turn away from the beauty of this world.,Kotomi Ichinose
The day before yesterday, I saw a rabbit. Yesterday, it was a deer. And today, it’s you.
--Kotomi Ichinose
You’re the spore of a flower. You’ll be going on a trip, taken away by the wind. To go to new places and meet new people. You shouldn’t always rely on your sister. Even if you’re apart, your bonds still remain. That’s what family is.
--Youhei Sunohara
You're trying to stay unscarred, aren't you? If you've come this far, you'll have to hurt someone. The more time you take to decide, the deeper and more it'll hurt. For all of you.
--Youhei Sunohara
If you get all worked up yourself, you’ll always get someone who’ll rebel. Being too eager brings negative results.

Who can gaze into the mirror without becoming evil? The mirror does not reflect evil, but creates it.
--Motoko Kusanagi
There are countless ingredients that make up the human body and mind, like all the components that make up me as an individual with my own personality. Sure, I have a face and voice to distinguish myself from others, but my thoughts and memories are unique only to me, and I carry a sense of my own destiny. Each of those things are just a small part of it. I collect information to use in my own way. All of that blends to create a mixture that forms me and gives rise to my conscience.
--Motoko Kusanagi
We weep for the blood of a bird, but not for the blood of a fish. Blessed are those with a voice. If the dolls could speak, no doubt they'd scream, ""I didn't want to become human"".
--Motoko Kusanagi
I feel confined, only free to expand myself within boundaries.
--Motoko Kusanagi
If we all reacted the same way, we'd be predictable, and there's always more than one way to view a situation. What's true for the group is also true for the individual. It's simple: overspecialize, and you breed in weakness. It's slow death.
--Motoko Kusanagi
I find no fault with you when it comes to standing against your enemy with courage. However, every few have the strength to sheath their sword once it's out.

When do you think people die? When they are shot through the heart by the bullet of a pistol? No. When they are ravaged by an incurable disease? No. When they drink a soup made from a poisonous mushroom!? No! It’s when... they are forgotten.,Hiluluk

If you simply obey orders without question to protect your master, that isn't your greatest wish, but your greatest tragedy.

I know that I have no strengths to offer. It irritates me how weak I am. But let me protect them!,Yona
I always wanted to become stronger. At first it was to protect myself. Next, it was to protect Hak, who gave up everything for me. Now, it's to repay my friends, who enabled me to live.
--Yona
When you protect someone you want to keep safe, do you always weigh your own life against theirs?

Kindness is not a crime. But sometimes it awakens the weakness and greed in others.,Su-won

However, even if it is reckless... I don't think someone who is making their best effort to try and break through the current situation is foolish.
--Su-won
No matter how foolish or incomprehensible, some love cannot be discarded. You may try to stop your heart, unable to forgive yourself, but there will be times when you lose hope and your heart is moved again.

There is strength in words... Sometimes, they become words of power. I thought that if I said I'm fine, then I really would be fine. But it's no use... It doesn't work.

You're the idiot. 3D girls are way too much trouble. The first is ""the most beautiful girl in school"

Though, from the moment we become friends,
we'll never speak to each other again.

We have no choice but to accept the one and only life we're given, no matter how cruel and heartless it might be.
--Yuri Nakamura
What does it mean to be reborn?
That isn't the life I had anymore.
It's someone else's life.
Everyone only gets to live life one time,
and it's right here. I only get it once. This is my life.
I can't entrust it to someone, I can't steal a new one,
I can't force it on others, I can't forget it or erase it.
I can't stomp over it, laugh at it, or beautify it! I can't anything!
I'd have to accept my one shot at life no matter how cruel, merciless, or unfair I thought it was! Sir, don't you understand? That is why I must fight. I must keep on fighting! Because... because I can never accept that kind of life!
--Yuri Nakamura
Humans don't even have the patience to wait even ten minutes for something!,Yuri Nakamura
I only have one chance to have my life, and it's right here. It's the only life I have. This is my life. I can't give it to anyone else, It can't be stolen, I can't force it on anyone, or forget it, or make it disappear, or trample on it, or laugh it away, or beautify it. I have no choice but to accept this one cruel, meaningless life! That's why I will fight, and why I will continue fighting.
--Yuri Nakamura
I'll marry you! No matter what kind of sickness you have! Even if you can't walk or stand, or even when you can't have kids! I'll still marry you!

--Yuzuru Otonashi
I... don't know why I'm alive. I have no reason to live. I have no interest in others. Living without concern for others... That's the way to live. Working a job that earns me just enough to eat... A life like that was enough...,Yuzuru Otonashi
One person needed courage to face the past.
Another person needed effort to make a dream come true.
Yet another person needed time and friends.
What about you?
--Yuzuru Otonashi
Our lives were real! Not a single moment of them were fake! Everyone lived the best they could! We carved those memories into ourselves! Memories of living as hard as we could! No matter what kind they were, they're the life we led! Erasing them in the blink of an eye like that... Wasn't your life also real to you?!
--Yuzuru Otonashi
My life after losing her... Is it over as well? The days I spent satisfied with the happiness I never noticed... Those times had passed away. For me... There's nothing left at all.,Yuzuru Otonashi

Truly and deeply, thank you for giving, my life to me.

No matter what kind of past you had, don't lose sight of yourself.
--Ayato Naoi
I heard that when things were painful for her, she'd cover her ears with headphones and escape to the world of music. I tried it too. It was like everything was blown away. The vocals screamed for me. They grieved for me. The ones who put on the act of common sense were wrong. Those who cried were right. We, the lonely were more human. They screamed at the absurd, beat it down, and destroyed it. They saved me.
--Masami Iwasawa

If you want to get to know someone,

Being able to cry for his companion.
I was thinking you couldn't cry,
nor did you have a heart.
But in that case why... even a little...
don't you share that feeling... 
with all the people you kill !!

After being driven out of the orphanage, I had nothing to eat, nowhere to sleep, and, as one might expect, not a cent to my name. Yet, I lack the courage to commit theft. That is how I've arrived at my current predicament... However... if I wish to live, I have no choice but to steal and take from others!

I intended to listen to your voice, but it really was nothing but intentions. It's pretty obvious, huh? Of course there's more going on than what people choose to tell you... But I convinced myself that was all there is to a person. I knew that, but still I interpreted the stuff I didn't understand about you in ways convenient for me... That's just how I am.
--Shouya Ishida
Things would have been so much better back then... If we had heard each other's voices. I hate myself. I was selfish, and I never thought about anyone else's feelings. Since then, my classmates have all looked down on me. I've lived for seventeen years, and I haven't lived one of them as a good person. The only time I heard your voice was when we got into that fight. And what pisses me off the most is the fact that I haven't changed at all since back then! But.,. But now, I think I can understand what you were saying... Nishimiya. Me and you... Can we be... friends? Shit!! I went way too far!! I was just gonna apologize and get out of here! Why the hell did I end up asking her to be friends?... Why did I even say that?! Jeez, that's so embarrassing! How can you even say that?
--Shouya Ishida
Just your touch... gets me excited. It makes me so happy. But those feelings will all turn into pain. The happier I am now, the more it'll hurt. I know how cruel this is... but no matter how hard I try, I can't rid myself of this. Nejima-kun... I... don't know... what love is.
--Misaki Takasaki
I don't really want you to understand... I just don't want you to be like, 'Oh, is that all'? I don't need people to get it. These feelings... are important to me, and they're just for me.
--Misaki Takasaki
What is love? Its when your eyes start following someone, and you look for them if they’re not around. You get excited thinking you might run into him when you’re putting your shoes on in the morning. And when you don’t it’s a little disappointing. But then you pass by him and that makes you happy for the rest of the day. It feels like you can handle anything. Seeing him is enough to make you happy.
--Misaki Takasaki
Sometimes, I wonder why people fall in love. Why do we abandon ourselves... to these painful and burdensome feelings?
--Yukari Nejima
Even though you like someone already, your partner is decided for you... and you can't do anything about that crush. Because everyone keeps getting in the way... and saying you can't... But... when you're the one in love... the only thing that feels true... is that feeling.
--Yukari Nejima
It was rough. It was so painful. I was so scared. I was so sad. It hurt so much, I thought I'd die. I tried so hard... I tired so hard! I was so desperate, so desperate to make everything right! It's the truth. I've honestly never tried so hard at anything in my life! Because I loved this place... Because it was so important to me! I was so desperate to get back. I was scared... I was so scared! I didn't want those eyes looking at me like that again... And I hated myself so much for feeling that way!
--Subaru Natsuki
All those times I got hurt, all the crying I did, all the pain I felt, all the fighting I did with my life at stake... And my reward was her name and a single smile. Jeez... Talk about unequal compensation.

--Subaru Natsuki
While we talk, look forward to making up for all the time you've wasted looking back! We can start by talking about tomorrow. You can say anything like, whether you'll make Japanese or Western style breakfast tomorrow, or whether you'll put on your right or left shoe first. It can be something silly like that. No matter how silly it is, you can talk about tomorrow because you have a tomorrow.
--Subaru Natsuki
No matter what painful things happens, even when it looks like you'll lose... when no one else in the world believes in you... when you don't even believe in yourself... I will believe in you!
--Rem
Ever since that fiery night, my time has been stopped. But it was you who melted my frozen heart and kindly made my stopped time begin to move forward again.
--Rem
I can always tell when you’re lying. I also know that you cannot tell me why you do so. So there is no need to convince me, or wrap everything in lies, or try to take the blame on yourself like that. Because I have complete faith in you, Subaru-kun.

When you said that you hate yourself, it made me want to tell you all the wonderful things I know about you.
--Rem
I love it when you stroke my hair. I feel as if we can understand each other through the contact between your hand and my hair. I love your voice. Just hearing you say one word makes my heart feel warmer. I love your eyes. Normally, they look stern, but when you're being kind to someone, I love the way they soften. I love your fingers. For a boy, you have such lovely fingers. But when they clutch me, I know they are the strong, slender fingers of a man. I love the way you walk. When we walk together, I love the way you occasionally turn, to make sure I keep up. I love the way you look when you sleep. You look unguarded, like an infant, and your eyelashes are on the long side. When I touch your cheek, you calm down... And when I playfully touch your lips, you don't even notice... And it makes my heart ache terribly. I love you.

The amount of money one owns ultimately decides the victor. This doesn't stop within the walls of a casino, or it's cash flow. It's a rule that forms the basis for a capitalist society!
--Yumeko Jabami
The only one who can decide your worth.. is you. If you want to earn something, you need to reach out for it. Pro-athletes give up their teenage years to train. Business owners put up collateral to borrow money. That's how it always works. To make your ambitions come true, you have to take risks. The larger the ambition the greater the risk. That might involve time or enough work to affect your lifespan... So make your choice. Live in peace as a wannabe or risk losing it all to reach the very top. You're the one who needs to decide.

They say people can change, but is that really true? If they decide they want to fly, will they grow wings? I don't think so. You don't change yourself, you change how you do things. You have to make your own way. You have to create a way to fly, even while you stay the same.

Whats the probability of drawing the ace of spades from a deck with no jokers? Normaly it would be 1/50. But what if its a brand new deck? The position of cards in a new deck are typically identical, so that means if you take out the jokers and draw the card at the very bottom, it's the ace of spades almost 100% of the time. Oh that's right! I didn't say a word about it being a new deck. Rather, you didn't ask. Being in the ""no"" gives you the power to turn the probability of winning from 1.92% to 100%. The more knowledge of a party will be the inevitable victor.
--Sora
Because of our weakness, we trained our eyes, ears and the ability to think. Learning how to survive, that's our trait as humans! The human species can't use magic and can't even perceive it—but because we are weak, we have the wisdom to run away from magic and the intelligence to see through it! We don't have any extraordinary senses. But because we are weak, by learning and gaining experience, we gained the wisdom to achieve the unachievable—to predict the future...Rejoice! We are humans; we are the most talented people! Precisely because we were born without any ability, we can achieve anything. This is the will of the weakest race!

Throughout all of history, no wise king has ever forced his army to obey him through oppression. People will only truly fight for what is right.

All our needs, desires, and instincts seek cuteness, and it is for cuteness that we will give everything we have! That's just the way men are!

That's why it's so fulfilling when you find the solution. There are ways to find an answer promptly, or more freely. Even roundabout methods can bring you to a definite solution. The method may not be pretty, but when the answer you worked hard to discover is right, it makes you happy.

The phony peace that heroes create will dye people with evil. That's why I'm doing this. I will be the Count Devil that plunges humanity into terror! In a world with no room for survival, evil will disappear. And so will bullying, and discrimination, even war! What this world needs is not biased Justice but unbiased, absolute Evil! I'm fighting for world peace. No justice will be able to overthrow me. I will be stronger than anyone! I will be an absolute MONSTER!
--Garou
This strength doesn't make any sense. It's not fair. It's like he's made up of the world's unfairness. As if he is the personification of justice... of course. Didn't I already know? This world is unfair. Justice and evil are decided by others. That's how the world is. To oppose the unfair power known as justice, I have to obtain the unfair power known as evil. To defeat the unfair beings known as heroes I have to become an unfair being myself!
--Garou
If you weren't here, I would have become the world's absolute evil. Unbiased terror scattered throughout the world that can establish real peace. Don't think that all children are waiting for heroes. There are even kids around the world waiting for a great monster to take the stage. Can you save them? Can you follow the ugly kid being picked on in the park? I can. I can save the whole world with terror! While humanity is fearing Garou the Monster, everyone's hearts will unite to survive. Is there any peace other than this? Can you create peace? Can you, unbiased, save the world with that flimsy cape? Do you have the means to stop the unseen tragedies? You're strong... but so what? You may defeat me, but can you handle it? The responsibility. Well? If you're going to defeat me then answer the question! What will you accomplish? Why will you kill me now? Do you have a sense of duty like mine? Why are YOU a hero!?

Let’s say I posed this question to you: “Can all human souls be bought with money or not?” Now remember, the keyword here is “all”. The answer is “There are times when you can buy them, and other times, not,” right?

Dying means to be gone. And what goes, is not your pain, but your existence itself. But in your mind, you think that you’d have a sense of “nothing” after you die. How can you call that “nothing”? In other words, you don't even have an idea of what death is really like.
--Izaya Orihara
Have you ever thought about why you're so good and your parents are so bad? If you'd so kindly let me give away the answer; it's because even if you're cheating on someone or you're being cheated on, everyone laughs at bad jokes and eats over-sweet boiled vegetables.

I'm prepared for anything! Up until now, I have been running away from every fight, afraid of losing. But running away is even worse than losing. Unless one continues to fight, without succumbing to the pain of defeat, it is impossible to achieve victory. That is what people I love taught me.

There is no such thing as ""truth"" or ""lies"" in this world; there never has been. There are only plain, hard facts. And yet, all beings who exist in this world acknowledge only those ""facts"" that are convenient to them, and take them to be the ""truth"". They do so because they know no other way of living. However, for those powerless beings who comprise the majority of this world's population, inconvenient facts that affirm their very existence, are their only truth.

No matter what may happen... As long as you walk by my side... There shall be no enemy that can stand before us.,Sousuke Aizen
You are fighting out of obligation, not out of hatred. You will never reach me like that. Battle without hatred is like a bird without wings. You’ll never defeat anyone like that. You powerless friends are just weights that will break your legs.
--Sousuke Aizen
I had no intention of deceiving anyone. It's just that none of you could understand...My true self.,Sousuke Aizen
Why are you putting so much distance between us? If you want to make sure it hits me, then you should get close and fire. Or is it that you're afraid of letting even a part of me out of your field of vision by getting close? If that's the case, then it's a foolish thought. Distance only has meaning in a fight between equals. With you and I, distance holds no meaning at all. Watch... If I do this, my hand is almost instantly at your heart.
--Sousuke Aizen
If you ask anyone to name a universal rule that governs animals and humans alike, I bet you most people would answer ""survival of the fittest"". There are strong people and there are weak people. At a glance, it looks like the difference is pretty clear-cut. But the truth is, there's a lot more to it than just a simple battle of ""strong"" against ""weak"
-- of kill or be killed. You must understand what I'm talking about too, right? The true meaning of ""survival of the fittest"" isn't as simple as all that.
--Riruka Dokugamine
Survival of the fittest' is just a pretty lie that they tell you. A lie to make weak people believe that if they try their best, they can come out on top. Truth is, it isn't the weak that get eaten. It's not about strength, it's about numbers. The ones who stand at the top of the food chain are the brainless dolts. The loudmouths. Because there are so, so many of them. You know it's true. Everybody does. You all just turn a blind eye and pretend not to notice.

It's impossible to feel exactly the same as someone else... but when you both care for each other, your hearts are able to draw a little closer together. I think that's what it means to make your hearts as one.

It's just that... It's just that not being able to fight with everyone makes me feel lonely...!! But what would make me feel worse than being lonely is getting in everyone's way... that would make me feel worse!!

There were a lot of things I wanted to do. I wanted to become a teacher, and an astronaut, and a baker... I wanted to go to a bunch of different donut shops and ask for one of everything!

Then I could have been born in five different towns, and eaten five lifetime's worth of food, and had five different careers, and... fallen in love with the same person, five times.

Don't you think it's futile to live in fear of death? I mean, everyone is going to die sometime, so is there any point in pretending not to see it for the present? Or instead, I wonder if they think it doesn't concern them, since they aren't going to die.

Step one foot outside, and with one pull of a trigger, you can inflict a fatal injury; with one push of a button, you can blow up a whole lot of people at once. The world truly is a cavalcade of efficiency in violence. Still... whether hacking each other with stone axes, cutting each other with swords, shooting each other with guns, cursing each other with magic, or taking aim at each other with missiles, for some reason, there's a craving that grips us, from which we can't evolve away.

Death is a privilege of the living. A destiny without reason, continually roving on, evermore. How fleeting a thing it is. One cannot live and forget about death. The despair that is me, forgotten by death, can at least embrace my yearning at twilight, and sleep.

Humans should never be turned into vampires. But in the old days, hidden from history, when the war between vampires and vampire hunters was at its peak, vampires turned many humans into vampires to use in battle. And now the aristocrats have the duty to manage those survivors. Sometimes we have to kill them off...
--Kaname Kuran
A human bitten by a pureblood vampire transforms into a vampire. When that happens, there can be only one of two results, dying from the loss of blood, or unfavorably surviving and suffering the pain of slowly transforming into a vampire. Other vampires don't possess this dark power that purebloods have. I respect his strength of will, he was only a human, yet he resisted the powerful vampire instinct for four years.

If my only option I have is to lose you, then I would prefer death instead. Be it yours, by my hand, or could you please kill me then yuki..?

A glimpse of what I saw earlier
was something so distant from me.
And yet right now,
this man is lying here in my arms.
It's such a strange feeling.
--Yuuki Cross
When I think of him,
I feel so much love and such sadness...
is it a bad thing that the same feeling
makes me want to latch onto his throat
and devour his blood and even his life
to taste his feelings in it?
--Yuuki Cross
If it's something I can only cry about in my heart,
it's almost like a sin.
--Yuuki Cross
I long for him...but I understand.
There's a line that vampires and humans can't cross.
--Yuuki Cross
Both of us understand,
but neither of us will say it.
It's a sin to keep a vampire alive
by offering my own blood as bait.
We are doing something that is forbidden.
No one must find out about this.

The world is dyed with the color of blood.

That's why for you, you have the right to be cruel to me. No matter how much you make me worry or how much danger you put me in, just as much as you like. But these are not enough ""compensation"". Even if I have to sacrifice my left over life for you, I would not utter a word of complaint.

Pain is the way to bring peace.,Pain
Sometimes you must hurt in order to know, fall in order to grow, lose in order to gain because life's greatest lessons are learned through pain.
--Pain
People are stupid. If I don't do this, there will be no peace. Eventually, time will pass and the pain will heal. Eventually, checkmate's power will weaken and people will begin fighting again. This time, they will use the weapon themselves and once more know true pain. And for the short time, peace will come again. It will give birth to short period of peace within this endless chain of hatred. That's my wish.
--Pain
Do you understand pain a little now? If you don't share someone's pain, you can never understand them. But just because you understand them doesn't mean you can come to an agreement. That's the truth
--Pain
Even children are forced to grow up in the face of pain.,Pain
Love is the reason why there is pain. When we lose someone precious to us, hate is born. Vengeance is the product of that hate and so death follows. But in death there is only more death. This will give rise to more pains. In this cursed world we live in, it is a cycle of hatred that will not cease. You and I seek the same thing that Jiraiya-sensei wanted. Let me ask you this: How will you confront this hatred in order to create peace?
--Pain
We are but men, drawn to act in the name of revenge that we deem to be justice. But... if there is justice in revenge then that same justice will breed only more revenge... and trigger a cycle of hatred.
--Pain
You think you're the only ones who matter. You think you can put off death. But that peace made you foolish and thoughtless. If you kill someone, someone else will kill you... this hatred binds us together.
--Pain
Human nature pursues strife.,Pain
Justice comes from vengeance, but that justice only breeds more vengeance.

In life, it's better to assume that bad things will happen to you rather than good things. You can't look at someone else's success and assume that it will happen to you. There are a lot of people in the world, so it makes sense that one or two of them are going to be fortunate. But there's only one of you. Assuming that good fortune will come to you is no different than pointing a finger at a random person and predicting the same for them. But do you think that prediction would come true?

It's true that there's a lot we don't know about this world. But that's why we must go forward and do what we can. One thing at a time.,Shiroe
If you're going to give up that easily, we have no hope.

Protecting someone means giving them a place to belong. Giving them a place where they can be happy.,Rayneshia El-Arte Corwen
Adventurers are free. They are more free than we are. It's true that we may be weaker than they are. But that doesn't mean that, in our weakness, we can become aggressive. We don't have the right to take advantage of our weakness and use them as tools!
--Rayneshia El-Arte Corwen
Having feelings for someone just brings sorrow to someone else. Someone always gets sacrificed and suffers. If this is what it means to fall in love, then falling in love is terrible.
--Hikari Sakishima
Whether you like me or not, the fact that you're precious to me won't change, no matter what.

I wasn’t scared that I’d be rejected, I was scared that if I said how I felt, all of our relationships would change.

Having too many bonds causes one to lose focus, weakening their strongest wish, their greatest desire.
--Sasuke Uchiha
Tears and rain, fall down on my face, my body is unable to stay yet my heart is unwilling to leave.
--Sasuke Uchiha
If you think I'm just a foolish kid ruled by his emotions, that's fine. Following Itachi's path would be childish, the whispering of fools who don't know hatred. If anyone else tries to ridicule the way I live, I'll slaughter everyone they ever cared about. And then maybe they'll understand what it's like to taste... a little of my hatred.
--Sasuke Uchiha
My name is Sasuke Uchiha. I hate a lot of things, and I don't particularly like anything. What I have is not a dream, because I will make it a reality. I'm going to restore my clan, and kill a certain someone.
--Sasuke Uchiha
I understand now. Even if I must take the devil's fruit, I must gain power. I am an avenger.
--Sasuke Uchiha
*Talking to Naruto* Just shut up for once! What the hell do you know about it?! It's not like you ever had a family in the first place! You were on your own right from the beginning, what makes you think you know anything about it?! Huh?! I'm suffering now because I had those ties, how on earth could you possibly understand, what it feels like to lose all that?!
--Sasuke Uchiha
I have long since closed my eyes... My only goal is in the darkness.,Sasuke Uchiha
Even if it's been a while, you should remember your comrades faces. Why? Because otherwise you will hurt their feelings when they call out to you.

Just because someone is important to you, it doesn't necessarily mean that, that person is good. Even if you knew that person was evil... People cannot win against their loneliness.

He was the one who taught me to deepen my bond with my people. Thanks to him, I was able to regain my true self. That village has him, the one who cherishes a friend's bond more than anyone I know. Naruto Uzumaki... Knowing him and the friends he holds so dear, they will overcome this disaster and grow even stronger from it.
--Gaara
This is where it all starts for me. Starting with this small bond. I too want to become someone who is needed, instead of a weapon that is feared.
--Gaara
Perhaps the companionship of an evil person is preferable to loneliness.,Gaara
When you feel the honor of your idol under scrutiny... you become enraged, as if it were your own honor being questioned. The more precious your idol is to you... the harder you fight for him.
--Gaara
I am a relic they want to get rid of, so why do I exist and live? In order to exist you need a purpose, to exist for no reason is the same as being dead... I would love only myself and fight for only myself. If all other people exist to magnify that love, then there is no more a splendid universe than this one...
--Gaara
The corpse's bitter crimson tears flow and mingle with the endless sand, filling the chaos within me - and making me stronger.

A soul needs a purpose to live...and so I concluded that my purpose was to kill everyone besides myself. I felt alive...,Gaara

Real power is forged from the desire smoldering in the heart. It fans into a flame and begins to burn with an intensity scarcely imagined to be possible.,Orochimaru
Maybe, just maybe, there is no purpose in life... but if you linger a while longer in this world, you might discover something of value in it.

There probably isn't any meaning in life. Perhaps you can find something interesting to do while you are alive. Like how you found that flower. Like how I found you.,Orochimaru
Darkness. When everything that you know and love is taken away from you so harshly. All you can think about is anger, hatred and even revenge. And no one can save you.

I want to obtain all the jutsu and gain a true understanding of everything in this world. The first one to mix blue and yellow called the new color ""green"". I want to do something similar to that. If blue is the chakra, then yellow is the seal, and green is the jutsu... Just as there is no end to the variety of colors, there are so many thousands...tens of thousands of jutsu in the world as well. But in order to obtain every possible jutsu and truth, it would require an eternity. Only one who understands everything after spending such time on this can be fittingly called the Ultimate Being.

""Are you prepared to die?"". Most astronauts answer with a simple ""yes"
-- but you can say anything. It's just a weak yes. You shouldn't be prepared to die. Instead, you should have the resolve to live until the very end! If there's someone who replies ""no"
-- you can trust them.

Fragility is always lurking behind our peaceful day-to-day life. Terrible things don’t only happen in places far beyond our reach.,Kyousuke Natsume
Love requires no reason. That is what makes it love!,Kyousuke Natsume
A peaceful every day life hides its fragility. Fear and violence aren't just something in another world, completely unrelated to us. If a disaster happens, we can't change it. But as long as we small gears are linked together, we can keep moving forward, even if it's only one small step at a time.
--Kyousuke Natsume

I study too, you know. How could I teach anyone if I didn't grow and learn day by day. Now let's get rid of this dangerous cloth. Experiencing my Absolute Defense Form over summer vacation taught me yet another skill: compressing not my whole body, but a portion of my tentacles to release a burst of energy. Remember this Itona, I say assassination is education. The assassination classrooms teacher will get stronger every time he teaches!
--Koro sensei
Fun times are bound to end.,Koro sensei
As you go through life, the might current of society is bound to get in your way and there will certainly be times that things don't go as you'd hoped. When this happens, don't look to society for a cause. Do not renounce society. Frankly, you'd be wasting your time. Instead just say, ""That's life!"" and muddle your way through with frustration. Once you're past it, consider: If society's swift current is tossing you around, how should you be swimming there in it's midst. You should have learned how, here in the E class, in this assassination classroom. You don't always have to stand and face it head-on. You can run and you can hide. If it's not against the rules, you can try a sneak attack. You can use unconventional weapons. Stay determined - not impatient nor discouraged - and with repeated trial and error, you're bound to reach a splendid outcome eventually.
--Koro sensei
The past you've lost will never come back. I myself have made so many mistakes... But we can learn from the past so we don't repeat it.,Koro sensei
If I wasn't prepared to be flexible as the situations demands, I wouldn't have become a teacher.

The world will always be filled with injustice. If you have time to give up or hold a grudge against that injustice, then use that time to enjoy battling those injustices instead.
--Koro sensei
You may have grown too strong. Drunk on your own power, you forgot to put yourself in the shoes of someone weaker than you. That makes you no different than the student in the main campus.

Broadly speaking, there are two reasons a person feels the desire to teach something: Either he wants to pass on his successes or he wants to pass on his failures.
--Koro sensei
All of the connections we encounter in this world serve as teachers who nurture us.,Koro sensei
Those who can't do what they have to when the time comes for action will find their presence fading in our classroom. An assassin who neglects to sharpen his blade is no assassin at all. He's just a boastful brat swinging around a rusty sword.,Koro sensei
The difference between the novice and the master is that the master has failed more times than the novice has tried.,Koro sensei
Honestly, there isn't much meaning to the splendid names given to you by your parents. What does have meaning, is what the person behind that name does during their actual lifetime. The name doesn't make the person. The name simply remains gently within the footprint left on the path a person walks.
--Koro sensei
Exams are an opportunity to teach correctly the meaning of winning and losing, of strong and weak. Students soak up heaping helpings of successes and setbacks! Take in now what it means to win, what it means to lose!
--Koro sensei
Tests are a good thing. The knowledge gained from a night of cramming will be all but forgotten once you hit adulthood. And that's fine. The experience you gain through competition, having sharpened your skills and broadened your minds all under the same set of rules? That's the real treasure.
--Koro sensei
It’s dangerous for them to grow up without experiencing true competition. Because they’ll keep whining, even without taking the matter seriously. For those with a high level of aptitude... The sooner they know the frustration of defeat, the greater their growth will be.
--Koro sensei
Please remember that there are times to take someone's hand and lead them along... But also times when you must be stern and let them fend for themselves.,Koro sensei

If that treetop is school, and the ground is this place here... we all found our strength down on the ground. While looking up... and getting looked down on... we learned plenty about how scary heights were before we started climbing. That's why we can go our own way now. Still... Somewhere along the way we forgot our fear of heights, so we do still fall to the ground every now and then. So learn here. You can go on to school once you have a game plan. That's my secret lesson, from me to you.

It's okay to live, even if there's no greater point to living.
--Yuuki Konno
Because of my last moments are such fulfillment. I can end my journey surrounded by so many people, in the arms of the person I love. I... I did my best to live, I lived here.
--Yuuki Konno
There are things you can only share with someone by fighting. For instance, how serious you are.
--Yuuki Konno
I always say what exactly what I'm feeling, and if they don't like me, that's fine! It doesn't change the fact that I was close to their hearts.
--Yuuki Konno
If you're alone... if it's just your life, you can use it however you please/ Wear yourself out, get cut to ribbons, doesn't matter. But when there's two, the blade grows heavy. Fighting like death doesn't concern you becomes a thing of the past. It's no longer just you. I threw away my way of life, relied on the strength of others, and somehow pushed on.

Look, look around carefully. Strain your eyes. At the darkness around us... At the darkness... around me. You said, ""anywhere but here"". This is where. Here at the border. Gathered by the winds. Those who've met their final destiny hanging between jealousy and regret. Those who failed, swept together here. You say ""It doesn't matter where"". If you follow me, this is where you'll go! This is your Eden! You run from it. It is no Eden. If you follow me... to this place... the entire world... is a battlefield.

My place really was here. I was too foolish and stubborn to notice. But, what I truly hoped for then was here. Why do I always realize it... when I've already lost it.

Do whatever you want now. But if you disturb me, I'll kill you.

Unlike demons, you’re base, you harbor a complicated malice, you lie… You struggle desperately, knocking down others in your way… You steal and are stolen from, you make endless excuses… And still you strive to get over the hill and far away. I suppose that’s why humans are so interesting.
--Sebastian Michaelis
Yes, my lord. I devote my entire being to you. Until the day... that lies become truth.
--Sebastian Michaelis
You give up your future, lose your dream, are stained with despair... yet at the same time, you shake off you past, fight reality, and never lose your nobility.
--Sebastian Michaelis
Humans cannot reject temptation. When they are plunged into the depths of despair, likened to hell, they will hold on to anything that may help them escape from the situation they are in, even if it's merely a spider's thread, no matter what sort of humans they are.

Humans are easily tempted. When they are poised on the edge of hellish despair, and a spider-thin thread of salvation presents itself, they will invariably grasp it. No matter the human.

For a king to survive it's good for him to be able to skillfully manipulate the other pieces using both the knight and the queen. Beneath the throne the bodies of your pieces will pile up along with your sins. You must not lose.,Sebastian Michaelis

--Sebastian Michaelis
Even though I dislike being kicked by others, I do enjoy the feeling of kicking others.

The image reflected in a picture is but an illusion. However, even if it is an illusion, wishing to hold onto it is one of the hollow dreams humans have.
--Sebastian Michaelis
Once one has rejected faith, it will become impossible for him to enter the gates of Heaven.
--Sebastian Michaelis
At this moment, my body and soul, to the last hair, belong to my master.
--Sebastian Michaelis
If it is your wish, I will follow you anywhere, even if your throne crumbles, and your shiny crown turns to rust. Even if the bodies pile up endlessly above the bottomless pile of corpses. Beside you as you lie down softly, I will be, until I hear the words ""Check Mate""!
--Sebastian Michaelis
I can use my tongue to make a sakura branch into a butterfly knot.,Sebastian Michaelis
I'm just one hell of a butler...,Sebastian Michaelis
Poetry over philosophy. Embroidery rather than cooking. Dance instead of chess. Be an unknowing angel. Every girl born in the country of roses is raised by these three words.,Elizabeth Midford
Weak in order to love, strong in order to protect, both in order to stay at your side.

Life isn't that sweet. That's why everyone wants sweet things.,Undertaker
Wasted effort is one of the privileges of the youth.,Undertaker
How sad it would be if laughter should disappear.,Undertaker
Even though I told him to hold each and every soul dear. Because you hold great power you gradually fail to understand the importance of things that cannot be recovered. When it is realized and you lose your support...how many times have I given you and the others the same warning?,Undertaker
Love is a magnificent thing but, incidentally, it can also give birth to dreadful tragedy.
--Vincent Phantomhive
There is nothing shameful about being different from others. This is your character! Ann's red hair is really beautiful, just like the color of red spider lilies in their full bloom. Red really suits you. You should have more confidence in yourself.

A good man's past makes people curious! But if he's a bad man, then it makes me wanna see even more!
--Grell Sutcliff
I can finally appear before you in my real form! Because isn't it embarrassing to appear before a handsome guy without makeup?,Grell Sutcliff
Such an ice king you are! A beautiful tyrant! An angelic devil! A raven with the wings of a dove! My little lamb with the appetite of a wolf... My very own DARLING!!!,Grell Sutcliff
I'm going to use the heels of my shoes to step on this cold, uncaring face of yours! I want you to lick my shoes clean!
,Grell Sutcliff
Passion to insincerity, lies to reality, a stray dog into an Earl. That is butler.
--Claude Faustus
Master.. I will always stay by your side. Day and night, sugar and salt, living and dead, impure and pure.
--Claude Faustus
To touch something that is meant to transport food with one's shoes is a disgrace for a butler!,Claude Faustus
Day into night, sugar into salt, living to dead, and dark blue into gold.
--Claude Faustus
Between being eternally unable to wake from a dream, and being eternally unable to dream, which do you think would be more unfortunate? Still, both the dream that we deemed eternal, and this very reality, are destined to end someday.
--Lau
In this world, Earl, there're people who can't survive because of the cruelty of reality. I sell those people dreams.
--Lau
The spider's web has already been woven. The more you struggle, the harder it becomes to escape from those bonds. Whatever the prey, once they get involved with me, catching them is only a matter of time.
--Lau
I've got to exterminate the bad rats infesting my city, don't I? So I keep a cat. Meow!
--Lau
I was born alone in this world and alone I will die. If this is my fate, why are tears coming out of my eyes?

I have a dream at last. The butterfly trapped in spiderweb has no wings. That butterfly is... me.,Alois Trancy
Once drowned in the depths of darkness, you lose sight of light. When that light has dispersed there is no return. My light has died out long ago and so there's nothing back for me to go back, or look forward to I shall continue to indulge myself in this darkness until it completely consumes me, then I will be nothing but an empty course left on this cold & cruel world to rot.
--Alois Trancy
don't you think a sunny-side-up egg is pitiable? Its shell is broken and it's forced to publicly show an indecorous appearance. Then it becomes an eyeball, internal organs, or a plume. And I rob it of any and all possibilities.
--Alois Trancy
Show me those eyes. Not the eyes of those villagers who looked as if they'd seen a pile of vomit. Not the old man's greedy, inflamed eyes. That day, those eyes. Those eyes that longed only for me.
--Alois Trancy
My heart was entwined in a spider web. You'll always be my Highness. I wanted your love.,Alois Trancy
Whether time is slow or fast, depends on perception. Theory of relativity is so romantic.
--Kurisu Makise
Having someone to lean on is an amazing thing. Some things that can't be done alone can be achieved with the courage of two. And in times when you try your hardest and still can't make it work. When it's so tough you're ready to cry... if you have someone there to support you, you can make it through. The smallest words of support can save you.
,Ruri Gokou
Even if I know you'll reject me, even if I'm afraid you won't accept me, even if I know it will really hurt if you dump me - I still have to tell you how I feel!

If I were to lose a friend...then I couldn't die in peace!,Tsunayoshi Sawada
I consider everything that happened to be precious moments of my life. The pain. The suffering. The fun… And I am here right now, because everyone was there for me. I couldn't have accomplished anything by standing still, without anybody's help. I treasure every moment I have spent here. Unlucky? I feel pretty lucky. This is my resolve.

I don't know how to give up!!,Tsunayoshi Sawada
Enjoy your life today. Yesterday is gone, and the tomorrow might never come.

When you're really in trouble, of course I'd come and help. That's what friends are for, right?

It is sky that allows the cloud to move about freely. But someday, I will even bite up the sky itself.
--Kyouya Hibari
The word ""discipline"" is something that I would never give up, no matter what. But it's not because it is my pride that I will not give it up. It's because I cannot give it up, that's why it is my pride.

It's the sky...that allows the clouds to move about freely.,Kyouya Hibari

There's no time. Just do what he says for now. If he's lying, then we'll just blow his brains out.

If you can no longer believe in the person you love, then test him until you are satisfied.
--Bianchi
Keep in mind that there are those who get hurt and those who try to heal the hurt ones. For those guys, it's not funny to have something they value so much be brushed off so lightly. How can a man protect another if he can't even protect himself?
--Iemitsu Sawada
Hidden in truths lie lies, hidden in lies hides the truth.
--Mukuro Rokudo
An illusionists illusion countered by another illusion, has already lost it's own perception.
--Mukuro Rokudo
The reason you lost, was because you had me as your opponent.
--Mukuro Rokudo
Illusions... or real illusions. Hidden in an illusion is the real illusion. From one illusion will sprout another illusion. Hidden in truths lie lies, hidden in lies hides the truth.

As long as no one got hurt, it's all good. Who cares who saved who?
--Touma Kamijou
If you want to do something and have the power for it, then do it!
--Touma Kamijou
This is your life right? Then decide for yourself! If you want to protect everything with your hands then do so, if you want to abandon everything then do so. But, what do you yourself want to do right now? Can you really be satisfied giving someone else that you don’t really understand your most important thing?
--Touma Kamijou
Success comes only to those who have dared to stand up without fear!,Touma Kamijou
I don't need a reason to save someone.,Touma Kamijou
The same thing as always. No matter how many times I reach game over and no matter how many times I must pathetically hit continue, I will not stop moving forward.
--Touma Kamijou
Opportunities and success come only to those who do not fear to stand in the batter's box. Who want to hit the ball more than anything, and swing with all their might!
--Touma Kamijou
Is it that you get the power, then you choose to protect someone else? No! We first want to protect someone, that's why we try to get stronger in the first place.
--Touma Kamijou
God, if this world, this story, is moving ahead according to the system you created... then I first need to destroy that illusion!
--Touma Kamijou
Things like heroes are unnecessary. Can't you save someone if you're standing right there, at that very spot? In front of your eyes are people that don't wish to cry that are crying! In front of your eyes are people that can only clench their teeth while struggling and can't even say the words ""please save me""! Is that not enough?
--Touma Kamijou
Just because my reasoning is childish and wrong, and just because my argument can be easily defeated with a bit of cleverness, does not mean your reasoning is completely correct.
--Touma Kamijou
Damn it, I really don't want to follow her to hell... Looks like I'll just have to pull her out of it!

Why not just try hard again? Quit mopping around. Stop lying to yourself and try once more.,Mikoto Misaka
What you learn at your school is more important than where you go to school.,Mikoto Misaka
You don’t need a good reason to save a friend. If you want to save them, then save them. I know someone who kept saying those stupid things even when he was driven to the brink of death, and he really did save over 10,000 people in the end. And that idiot that saved so many people is trying to save someone today like always. I know I can’t stop him. No matter how much I don’t want him to do anything dangerous, seeing him off with a push to the back is the sign of a good woman!
--Mikoto Misaka
I've only just started to understand it myself. That by depending on others, and letting them depend on you, people can exceed what they can do as individuals.

If one side is putting all their efforts into killing a normal high school student and the other side is putting all their efforts into saving that normal high school student, which side do you want to be on? Which side could you proudly say you were on?

Just because I've gotten weaker, it doesn't mean that you've gotten stronger, right?
--Accelerator
The worst part about being strong is that no one ever asks if you're ok.,Accelerator
The second humans lose their comfort zone, the more simplistic their actions become.
--Accelerator
Listen, even if someone is suffering before you, the kind of person that can take up arms without hesitation to shoot down the villain is no better than a villain himself. The kind that doesn’t care about others, doesn’t give 2nd chances; someone that kills if given a reason, is definitely not a hero. You don’t have to become that kind of person. That’s my specialty. Only I have to go through that.
--Accelerator
I have no interest in being a villain, and I don’t think that I can become a good person. I’m at a halfway point where I’m not even sure which path I should walk down… but I guess even there, I can still interfere in someone’s life and help bring things to a positive conclusion…
--Accelerator
They may all look the same to you, but there are different kinds and different levels of evil. A first-class villain doesn't target honest lives.
--Accelerator
Listen up, kid. There's one thing you need to understand. Human life is a fragile thing. So weak that I can destroy it with a touch of my finger. So watch what you say. If you don't, I may break something I shouldn't.
--Accelerator
Those who hate themselves, cannot love or trust others.

Man fears the darkness, and so he scrapes away at the edges of it with fire. He creates life by diminishing the Darkness.

It is simply the duty of the elite to protect the ignorant masses.,Asuka Langley Soryu
My mind is being eaten away... Kaji-san, it's unravelling my mind! What do I do? It's defiling my mind!
--Asuka Langley Soryu
Humans constantly feel pain in their hearts. Because the heart is so sensitive to pain, humans also feel that to live is to suffer.
--Kaworu Nagisa
Humans cannot create anything out of nothingness. Humans cannot accomplish anything without holding onto something. After all, humans are not gods.
--Kaworu Nagisa
Are you afraid of other people? I know that by keeping others at a distance you avoid a betrayal of your trust, but you must endure the loneliness. Man can never completely erase this sadness, because all men are fundamentally alone. Pain is something man must carry in his heart, and since the heart feels pain so easily, some believe that life is pain.
--Kaworu Nagisa
The thread of human hope is spun with the flax of sorrow.,Kaworu Nagisa
No one can justify life by linking happy moments into a rosary.,Shinji Ikari
I still don't know where to find happiness. But I'll continue to think about whether it's good to be here... whether it was good to have been born. But in the end, it's just realizing the obvious over and over again. Because I am myself.
--Shinji Ikari
Mankind has no time left.,Shinji Ikari
Survivability takes priority.,Misato Katsuragi
This is your home now, so make yourself comfortable. And take advantage of everything here, except me.
--Misato Katsuragi
So fucking what if I'm not you?! That doesn't mean it's okay for you to give up! If you do, I'll never forgive you as long as I live. God knows I'm not perfect either. I've made tons of stupid mistakes and later I regretted them. And I've done it over and over again, thousands of times. A cycle of hollow joy and vicious self-hatred. But even so, every time I learned something about myself.
--Misato Katsuragi
If you know pain and hardship, it's easier to be kind to others.

Understanding 100% of everything is impossible. That's why we spend all our lives trying to understand the thinking of others. That's what makes life so interesting.,Ryoji Kaji
