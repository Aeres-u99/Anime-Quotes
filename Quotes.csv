There may be no other life forms that are truly a ""friend"" to man. Still, even if we can't comprehend them, they are, without a doubt, neighbors deserving of our respect. We protect other species because humans themselves are lonely creatures. We protect the environment because humans themselves don't want to go extinct. What drives us is simply self-gratification. But I think that's fine, and that it's really all there is to it. There's no point in despising humans by human standards. That's right.
